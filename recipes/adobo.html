    <h3>Pork adobo is a classic Filipino dish that is easy to prepare and full of flavor. </h3>
    <p>It's a savory and tangy stew made with pork, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and other spices.The dish typically involves marinating the pork in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar for a few hours, then simmering it in the same marinade with garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. This slow-cooking process allows the flavors to meld together and infuse the pork with a delicious tangy and salty taste.</p>
